  <p>I'm a third year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of British Columbia.
    I am a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 110 (Systematic Program Design)
    and 210 (Software Construction with Java). And love it! (See fig.2, fig.3)
    I enjoy puzzles and thinking through proofs - which drew me to Computer Science.</p>
  <p>Lately, I've been thinking about the *domain* of the puzzles I want to solve in my lifetime,
  which has led to start thinking about a second major in a Life Science.
  Pharmacology? Biochemistry? Proteomics? They all seem so ripe with complexity
  - and ready to be computationally reaped!</p>
  <p>I'm a very proud former member of the Military Medicine Institute (Singapore).
    I did not think much of myself prior to my time there and I have my commanders to thank for
    uncovering a lot of the better parts of who I am today. (See fig.2)</p>
