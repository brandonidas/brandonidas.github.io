            <h2 class="display-4">Let me introduce myself!</h2>
            <p>I love discovering and moving forward with those discoveries. I think my purpose in life is to be the bridge
              from the known into the unknown.
            </p>
            <p>I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of British Columbia.
              I TA for Computer Science 110 (Systematic Program Design)
              and 210 (Software Construction with Java) - and love it! (See fig.2, fig.3)
              I enjoy puzzles and thinking through proofs - which drew me to Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Lately, I've been thinking about the *domain* of the puzzles I want to solve in my lifetime,
              which has led to start thinking about a second major in a Life Science.
              Pharmacology? Biochemistry? Proteomics? They all seem so ripe with complexity 
              and ready to be computationally reaped!</p>
            <p>I'm a very proud former member of the Military Medicine Institute (Singapore).
              I did not think much of myself prior to my time there and I have my commanders to thank for
              uncovering a lot of the better parts of who I am today. (See fig.2)</p>

              <p> Nonetheless I can say that I used a public transit API to retrieve both the timings and variable
                routes of buses in British Columbia (yes bus routes in BC change seasonally especially around UBC). Then
                mapped
                these onto an a street map of the area.

              I initially did this because I drank too much coffee one evening. But looking at it, this web demo is much
              more presentable than
              just a repo.

    <p>From 2019, September to end of December, I'll be taking a gap term. I will return to coursework in January.
      In this down time, I will be focusing on resting as it's my first break in years, having gone straight from
      Military Service to back-to-back terms in UBC's gruelling trimester system.</p>
    <p>However, two weeks into my break, I've felt rested enough to attempt side projects. Here they are</p>
