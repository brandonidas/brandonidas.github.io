    <h1>My First Google Code Challenge</h1>
    <p>I recently got invited to complete a Google Code challenge for an *ML position* at their
      Singapore office. It surprised me a little because I didn't expect to hear back at all. 
      45 minutes, two questions and on an online code editor.
      <b>The true challenge was that I had never done a code challenge or practiced on leetCode.
        And I had 5 days to prepare.
      </b>
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation (And learning Python)</h2>
    <p>
      Practicing on leetCode began, the easy questions were trivial but the 'medium' questions 
      were more like 'impossible under a 45 minute time constraint'.
    </p>
    <p>I started in Java but after looking at both Java and Python solutions - 
      <i>it became clear; brevity of Python made it ideal for a timed challenge.</i> Perhaps also
      for interviewing.
    </p>
    <h2>The Challenge Itself</h2>
      <p>... was stressful. I spent around 8 minutes in a state of panic. NOTE: the challenge environment's 
        test I/O supplied input LINE BY LINE rather than as a Solution Object like in leetCode. So you
        would have to know how to parse the input from command line through Python's sys.stdin. However,
        I was unprepared for this and my state of panic turned what would normally be a 4 minute speed read into
        an 8 minute scramble. 8 of 45 precious minutes.
      </p>
      <p>The environment itself was quite poor. It disabled copy and paste 
        but guranteed internal copy-paste function would be unhindered - this complete non-function. Pasting would
      usually return a random string of numbers eg "165149614651" or a copy from several copies ago. Here'a screenshot nonetheless;</p>
      <br><img class="card img-fluid rounded" src="code-chal-env.png" alt=""> <br>

      <p>I had two questions, both 30 and 20 points respectively, I would rate them both as somewhere in between leetCode's easy and medium.
        Though first was <i>definitely harder</i> than the second, I only managed to complete the first questions
        and got only 75% of the way through the second.
        (only to have the solution come to me as I took an afternoon stroll that day. Interesting how that happens.)
      </p>
      <p>I'm not sure if I can post the questions or not, 
        but I will say I found them on leetCode forums later so keep grinding!
      </p>
    <h2>After Action Review</h2> 
      <p>As I said, the questions were already on leetCode, albeit as forum posts and not IDE problems, and 
        more interestingly as previous interview questions from Amazon.

      </p>
    <h2>Constructive Action</h2>
