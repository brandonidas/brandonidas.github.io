          <h1><i>Hey Leona</i></h1>
          <h3>TBH</h3>
          <p>First year <i>was</i> too chaotic. So the clinical diagnostic tools in my heads
          only really merged with my social skills this summer. Perhaps also because I
          spent more time with Joice and she's good at reading people.</p>
          <p>So what we can say now is "pretty and nice" - the two dimensional model -
          is insufficient to help me figure out who I'd be good with. I can start thinking
          in terms of clinical psychometrics but these "numbers" will never amount to the full
          experience of someone. They're just metrics.</p>
          <p>So that leaves me wondering, how else can you gauge someone - encompassing
          as many of their traits as possible and their effect on your relationship with them?
          You mentioned a deep feeling? I've felt that for maybe one person in my entire life.
          My Thai ex.</p>
          <h3>IDEAL "types"</h3>
          <canvas id="personality-chart"></canvas>
          <p>That chart was made using HEXACO - a 6 factor personality metric. http://hexaco.org/.
          It's by these metrics that I think pre-meds - calm, clinical, hardworking, somewhat extraverted -
          would suit me. At least better than a lot of my other peers. But these are just metrics and life
          is more complicated than that.</p>
          <p><b>Feeling.</b> My thai ex - she made me feel calm. There something else about her.
          Charisma or charm or something. She was so <i>motivating</i>. I want to make
          myself better for her. Be the man she deserves.</p>
          <p>But what's to say, she - or anyone else <i>special</i> - doesn't just make
          all guys (and girls) feel that way? Charismatic people have that effect.</p>
          <h3>Other Ideas</h3>
          <p>Women are naturally more empathetic, mature and socially intelligent.
          So, contrary to your surprise towards my immaturiy, I'm <i>not surprised at all</i>
          that you've figured this one out before me.</p>
          <p>Also I've made the changes to the main page as you suggested! Thanks!
